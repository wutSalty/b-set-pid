# What the heck is this

B Sets (also known as Waratah Series 2) are double-decker electric multiple units that operate on the Sydney Trains network. Compared to their predecesors, B Sets were the first to include LCD passenger information displays (PIDs) for upcoming stop information. Since their introduction in 2018, the PIDs have only gone through one major refresh. However, compared to other rail networks, the information displayed on the B Sets PID is extremely basic and a poor use of otherwise valuable screen space.

This project is a work-in-progress somewhat functional mockup of what a dense and information rich display could look like.

## WIP

- Add ability to customise the route displayed
- Add dark mode
- Possibly add an alternate station arrival screen
